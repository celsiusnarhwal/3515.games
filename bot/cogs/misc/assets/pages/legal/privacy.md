interacting with it.

  3515.games may collect and process the following information about **you with respect to the servers you share with it
  **:

- Your server nickname, if you have one
- Your server avatar, if you have one
- The permissions you have in this server or in a given channel in this server

  3515.games will also collect and process information you explicitly provide to it, such as via usage of its commands
  or interaction with its graphical user interfaces.

This information is sent to Discord for the purpose of allowing 3515.games to provide its basic functionality. By using

described. If you do not agree, you should refrain from using 3515.games and leave any servers you share with it.

\***\*Addendum: Chess\*\***

When you play chess with 3515.games, you may be given the option to "save" your game so that it can be replayed and
analyzed via the `/chess replay` command. Saved game data will include the Discord usernames and discriminators of both
you and your opponent; the name of the Discord server in which the game occurred; and the date on which the game took
place, and is stored in a database to which the developer of 3515.games has full read and write access.

If this makes you uncomfortable, you can disable saving on a per-game basis by setting the `saving` option to `Disabled`
when using the `/chess challenge` command. Whether saving is enabled for a particular game is publicly disclosed when
its game thread is created. If you unintentionally enable saving for a game, you can use the `/chess forfeit` command
before the game starts to quit it; in these cases, the option to save the game will not be presented.

You can delete your saved games via the `/chess replay` command (though if your opponent also saved the game, their copy
of the save data will persist).
