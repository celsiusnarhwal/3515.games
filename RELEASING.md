# Releasing

1. Checkout the `dev` branch.

2. If changes intended for release exist in branches other than `dev`, merge them into `dev`.

3. Run `kurisu check` and fix anything it complains about.

4. Start 3515.games.dev via [`bot/main.py`](bot/main.py) and then via `poe docker`.
   Ensure the bot successfully starts, runs, and responds to user interaction, then stop it.

5. Commit any uncommitted changes to `dev`.

6. Create a new **draft** release on GitHub with `gh release create`. The release tag **must** be the new version number
   _exactly_ as it appears in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml). Use the release notes generated by
   `kurisu notes`.

7. Push the `dev` branch to GitHub.

8. Open a pull request from `dev` to `main`. If there are no conflicts (and there better not be), merge it.

9. Place 3515.games in maintenance mode.

10. When you're ready to go live, publish the draft release you created in step 6 and create a new deployment
    on [Railway](https://railway.app).
