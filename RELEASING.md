# Releasing

1. Run `kurisu check` and fix anything it complains about.

2. Make sure the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) builds and runs correctly.

3. Commit any uncommitted changes to `dev`.

4. Merge `dev` into `main` via pull request.

   ```bash
   gh pr create && gh pr merge
   ```

5. Place 3515.games in maintenance mode.

6. Publish a new release on GitHub. The release tag must be the new version number _exactly_ as it appears in
   [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml). Use the release notes generated by `kurisu notes`. The publication of the release
   will automatically trigger a new deployment of 3515.games.
