# Self-Hosting 3515.games

# <small>Prologue: Heaven and the Earth</small>

If you're technically inclined, you can self-host 3515.games. You can go about this however you like, but this guide
will walk you through doing it how I do it.

Make sure you have the following:

<div class="annotate" markdown>

- :fontawesome-solid-laptop: A **computer** with an up-to-date version of :fontawesome-brands-apple: **macOS**, :fontawesome-brands-windows: **Windows**, or your favorite :fontawesome-brands-linux: **Linux** distribution
- :fontawesome-solid-server: Another computer suited to act as a **server**, such as a [:fontawesome-brands-raspberry-pi: **Raspberry Pi**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/)
