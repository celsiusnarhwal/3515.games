# Voice Chat

Games with Game Hosts support the creation of special linked voice channels via the :command:`/voice` command. These
channels are controlled by 3515.games and only accessible to the game's host and players. They're automatically
deleted when their linked game ends.

Game Hosts have moderator-like permissions in these channels, including the ability to mute and deafen other users,
disconnect users from the channel, and use [Priority Speaker](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011876531-Setting-up-Priority-Speaker-).

Games that support voice chat are denoted on this website with a special message:
