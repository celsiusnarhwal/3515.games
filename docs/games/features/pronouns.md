# Pronouns

You can choose the pronouns 3515.games refers to you with by creating a [PronounDB](https://pronoundb.org)[^1] account
and linking your Discord account to it. That's it; there are no additional settings to configure. Just create your
account, link your Discord account, and you're done.

This is **totally optional**. If your PronounDB account doesn't exist or isn't linked to Discord, 3515.games will
refer to you with they/them pronouns. (1)
{ .annotate }

1. Of course, this means that if your pronouns actually *are* they/them, you don't need to do anything. Hooray!

## Limitations

### Midgame Persistence

3515.games queries your pronouns from PronounDB whenever you become a player in a game and remembers only those pronouns
for the duration of the game. This means that changes you make on PronounDB won't be reflected in any ongoing games
you're in.

### Unsupported Pronouns

<div class="annotate" markdown>

The following PronounDB options are not supported, and 3515.games will fall back to using they/them if you pick one:

- Other pronouns
- Ask me my pronouns
- Avoid pronouns, use my name

</div>

1. This one could *potentially* be supported in the future. The other two are completely off the table, though.

Neopronouns and other things not supported by PronounDB are also not supported by 3515.games.
