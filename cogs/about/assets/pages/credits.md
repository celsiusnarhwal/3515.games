I hail from the mind of my creator, <@170966436125212673>. He designed and developed me all by himself. Pretty impressive, right?

My creator would like to personally thank the following people for their time, patience, and valuable feedback, which helped refine me into the bot I am today:

- Zander (Frosty) ([@slyzander](https://twitter.com/slyzander))
- clesius norhwale ([@clesiusnorhwale](https://twitter.com/clesiusnorhwale))

My creator would also like to acknowledge the following developers, whose software was instrumental in bringing me to life:

- JetBrains for [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- The Poetry team for [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- Docker, Inc. for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Cultured Code for [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things)

Finally, both my creator and I would like to thank you for using me. My creator worked very hard to build me, so it makes him very happy when people enjoy playing my games. :)
