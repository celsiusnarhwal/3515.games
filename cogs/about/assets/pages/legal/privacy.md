Discord [requires me](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/terms-of-service#a-implement-good-privacy-practices) to have a privacy policy, so here it is.

When you use or share a Discord server ("server") with 3515.games, 3515.games may collect and process various information about your Discord account ("you", "your", "your account") and, if applicable, the server in which you are interacting with it.

3515.games may collect and process the following information about **your Discord account**:

- Your user ID
- Your username (including your discriminator)
- Your avatar
- Whether or not you are a bot

3515.games may collect and process the following information about **servers it is in**:

- The server ID
- The server name
- The server's boost level
- The names and unique identifiers of the server's channels

3515.games may collect and process the following information about **you with respect to the servers you share with it**:

- Your server nickname, if you have one
- Your server avatar, if you have one
- The permissions you have in this server or in a given channel in this server
- What channels you can see, talk in, and/or are a member of

3515.games will also collect and process information you explicitly provide to it, such as via usage of its commands or interaction with its graphical user interfaces.

This information is sent to Discord for the purpose of allowing 3515.games to provide its basic functionality. By using or sharing a Discord server with 3515.games, you agree to the collection, processing, and use of this information as described. If you do not agree, you should refrain from using 3515.games and leave any servers you share with it.
