# About 3515.games' License

3515.games is licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). But what does that
mean for you?

You may be familiar with the GNU General Public License (GPL), which allows you to do almost anything you want with the
licensed software on the condition that if you share it with other people, you must also share the source code with them
under the same terms. The AGPL is the same thing with the additional condition that letting people use the software
over a network also counts as sharing it with them.

In the case of 3515.games, this means that **self-hosting the bot counts as sharing it with other people**, and you will
need to ensure you are complying with the AGPL if you do so.

## Key Points

### Share and Share Alike

If you share 3515.games with anyone, you must also share the source code with them and do so under the terms of the
AGPL. If you modify the source code and self-host it, you have to share your modified version, too â€” again,
under the terms of the AGPL. If you include 3515.games' source code in a larger program and share that program,
you have to share the *entire* program's source code under the terms of the AGPL.[^1]

### Credit Where Credit Is Due

Whenever you share the source code, you must include verbatim copies of both the AGPL and
[COPYING](COPYING). If you share a modified verion of the source code, you must prominently disclose that it's been
modified from the original and the date on which you first modified it, as well as that the source code is licensed
under the AGPL.

You are absolutely never allowed to pretend that you made 3515.games, misrepresent modified versions of 3515.games'
source code as the original work, or misrepresent unmodified versions of 3515.games' source code as your own work.

### One License to Rule Them All

You may only share 3515.games' source code under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. Other licenses
are strictly unacceptable, even if their terms appear to be equivalent to those of the AGPL.
