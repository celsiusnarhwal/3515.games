3515.games is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). But what does that
mean for you?

You may be familiar with the GNU General Public License (GPL), which allows you to do anything you want with the
licensed software on the condition that if you share it with other people, you must also share the source code with them
under the same terms. The AGPL is the same thing with the additional condition that letting people use the software
over a network also counts as sharing it with them.

## Key Points

### Share and Share Alike

If you share 3515.games with anyone, you must also share the source code with them and do so under the terms of the
AGPL. If you modify the source code and self-host it, you have to share your modified version, too â€” again,
under the terms of the AGPL. If you include 3515.games' source code in a larger program and share that program,
you have to share the *entire* program's source code under the terms of the AGPL.

**Self-hosting the bot counts as sharing it with other people.**

### Credit Where Credit Is Due

Whenever you share the source code, you also have to include a verbatim copies of both the AGPL and 
[COPYRIGHT](COPYRIGHT). If you share a modified verion of the source code, you have to include a prominent notice 
that it's been modified and the date on which you first modified it, as well as a prominent notice that the source 
code is licensed under the AGPL.

Where the text of [COPYRIGHT](COPYRIGHT) appears in 3515.games, it may not be altered or removed.

You are absolutely never allowed to pretend that you made 3515.games, misrepresent modified versions of 3515.games' source code as the original work, or misrepresent unmodified versions of 3515.games' source code as your own work.

### One License to Rule Them All

You may only share 3515.games' source code under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. Other licenses
are strictly unacceptable, even if their terms appear to be equivalent to those of the AGPL.
