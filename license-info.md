# About 3515.games' License

3515.games is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). But what does that
mean for you?

You may be familiar with the GNU General Public License (GPL), which allows you to do anything you want with the
licensed software on the condition that if you share it with other people, you must also share the source code with them
under the same terms. The AGPL is the same thing with the additional condition that letting people use the software 
over a network also counts as sharing it with them.

In the case of 3515.games' specifically, this means that **if you self-host the bot, you must share the source
code with anyone who can access your instance of it, and you must do so under the terms of the AGPL.** 
If you modify the source code and self-host it, you have to share your modified version, too â€” again, under the terms of
the AGPL.

You pretty much only need to worry about this if you plan on modifying the source code and/or self-hosting the bot or
otherwise distributing it to other people.
